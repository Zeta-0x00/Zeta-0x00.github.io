## What motivates me?

I've always been fascinated by technical challenges that involve thinking like an attacker in order to defend better. My main focus is in areas such as:


- Red Teaming : Simulating real attacks to identify weaknesses before the bad guys do.

- Exploit Development : Understanding code-level vulnerabilities and creating innovative solutions.

- Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering : Unravel the inner workings of malicious software to mitigate threats.

- Penetration Testing : Evaluate web, mobile and infrastructure applications to ensure their security.

In addition, I have a strong background in Machine Learning and Data Science, which allows me to approach complex problems from multiple perspectives.

## My Journey

I started in my youth by learning about Operating Systems, Virtualization and Networking. I quickly became interested in cybersecurity and began exploring various topics, including:
- **Operating Systems**: Understanding the inner workings of systems like Linux and Windows.
- **Networking**: Learning about protocols, firewalls, and network security.
- **Programming**: Gaining proficiency in languages like Python, C, and Assembly.
- **Malware Analysis**: Delving into the world of malicious software and reverse engineering.
- **Red Teaming**: Simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit Development**: Creating and analyzing exploits to understand vulnerabilities.

When I was in the college, I started to investigate and learn about the world of cybersecurity and Machine Learning. I think the fact that the core of my degree was computer science with subjects like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science had an influence on that.

## Current Focus
At the moment, I am:

- 🛠️ Improving my skills in red teaming and exploit development .
- 💻 Creating tools to facilitate penetration testing and security analysis.
- 🌐 Exploring the latest trends in AI, cloud and Web3 security.
- 🤝 Contributing to open source projects and education related to cybersecurity.

<!-- - 📚 Sharing my knowledge through articles, workshops and conferences -->
